The Olive Young e-commerce website redesign aims to provide users with a seamless and modern online shopping experience, focusing on premium Korean skincare products. The project targets skincare enthusiasts, beauty experts, and those looking for quality skincare solutions. The goal of the website is to offer a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that allows users to easily browse, explore, and purchase products while receiving detailed information and recommendations.

## Design Process
The design process for this project focused on creating a sleek, minimalist, and visually engaging website for OliveYoung's target audience, skincare consumers. This group values both aesthetics and functionality, requiring an easy-to-navigate website that offers product details, user-friendly shopping experiences, and a modern feel. To achieve these objectives, the design incorporates intuitive layouts, responsive elements, and clear call-to-action buttons, ensuring the website is accessible and visually appealing on any device.

User stories:
- As a skincare enthusiast, I want to browse through various skincare products, so that I can find the best options for my skincare routine.
- As a new user, I want to sign up for an account, so that I can receive marketing information and updates about discounts and events.
- As a shopper, I want to add items to my cart and proceed to checkout, so that I can complete my purchase quickly and easily.
- As a visitor, I want to access detailed product descriptions and images, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.
- As a customer, I want to easily access the contact page, so that I can reach out for support, ask questions, or provide feedback about my shopping experience.

- Advanced Product Filtering
  - An enhanced filtering system that helps users search products by type, ingredients, skin concerns, or price range.

## Technologies Used
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  - The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [HTML](https://html.com/)
  - HTML5 was used to structure the content of the website, ensuring semantic correctness and SEO optimization.
- [CSS](https://css.com/)
  - CSS3 was used to style the website, with Flexbox and media queries for responsive design to enhance the user experience.
- [JavaScript](https://javascript.com/)
  - JavaScript was used for interactive features, such as form validation, the shopping cart functionality, and dynamic page loading.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Visual Studio Code was used as the integrated development environment (IDE) to write and manage the website's code. 

## Testing
My contact form does not allow the user to submit an empty form and an error message about the required fields appears. When the user submits the form with all inputs valid, it is verified and a success message appears. My project works on both full screen computer size as well as mobile view.

Interesting bugs or problems I discovered during my testing, even if I haven't addressed them yet.
- I could not get my products to be in one straight line and they ended up being split into 2 different rows and the one below was slightly bigger
